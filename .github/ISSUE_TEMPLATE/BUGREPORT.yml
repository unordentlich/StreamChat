        Once upon a time there was a little green dinosaur. His name was Rex and
        he went on a journey with his friends. On the trip he met a female
        dinosaur named Rexina. They became best friends and always shared their
        food. At some point Rexina was hit by a tree during a heavy thunderstorm
        and Rex lost the love of his life. The End. :(


        *Joking, of course they have been in love and married until the end of their lives lmao
